**Calculator** is a very simple, partially working.. umm, calculator. 

- Single digit functionality for buttons 0 - 9
- Functional operations +,-,*,/,= 
- Label displays value 
- Clear button removes value 

 - Bugs

		- % function partially works, I think it's my math on this one. 
		- Switching sign (+/-) partially working, again likely my math and code. 

  - Todo 

		- Add decimal functionality
