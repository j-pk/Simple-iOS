# Simple iOS App Development 

_Leveraging various examples of Swift code to show developmental knowledge overtime._

- This repository holds the basic apps that will be worked on in class. 

##Simple Buttons 

**Calculator** is a very simple, partially working.. umm, calculator. 

- Single digit functionality for buttons 0 - 9
- Functional operations +,-,*,/,= 
- Label displays value 
- Clear button removes value 

Bugs

- % function partially works, I think it's my math on this one. 
- Switching sign (+/-) partially working, again likely my math and code. 

Todo 

- Add decimal functionality
