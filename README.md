# Simple iOS App Development 

_Leveraging various examples of Swift code to show developmental knowledge overtime._

- This repository holds the basic apps that will be worked on in class. 

##Simple 

**Todo List** a todo list to show UITableView functionality.

- Captures priority when creating new item
- Swipe to delete 
	- Need todo.. 
	 	- Swipe to right reveal more options 

**Tic Tac Toe** designing a tic tac toe game from scratch. 

**HackBack** example of code that randomize color, object shape, opacity, and rotation. 

 - <del>Still working</del> on rotation. Got it!

Normal Mode 

- Make box a circle
- Randomize the circle size (width will be the same as height)
- Randomize the color of the circle 
- Randomize the alpha of the circle


Middle Mode

- Transition to alpha 0 after 1 second
UIViewAnimation

Hard Mode

- Randomize rotation of box
- Randomize whether it is round or not 
- Randomize between full circle  > rounded square > square


**Body Parts** is a playground and our second assignment. 

  - Make a Class BodyParts
  - Make 20 Classes that are BodyParts
  - Each class will have 3 properties 
  - Each class will have 3 methods
  - At least 15 methods need to be call from another BodyParts
  - At least 10 properties need to be other BodyParts

**Calculator** is a very simple, partially working.. umm, calculator. 

- Single digit functionality for buttons 0 - 9
- Functional operations +,-,*,/,= 
- Label displays value 
- Clear button removes value 

 - Bugs

		- % function partially works, I think it's my math on this one. 
		- Switching sign (+/-) partially working, again likely my math and code. 

  - Todo 

		- Add decimal functionality
