# Simple iOS App Development 

_Leveraging various examples of Swift code to show developmental knowledge overtime._

- This repository holds the basic apps that will be worked on in class. 

##Simple 

**HackBack** example of code that randomize color, object shape, opacity, and rotation. 

 - Still working on rotation 

**Body Parts** is a playground and our second assignment. 

  - Make a Class BodyParts
  - Make 20 Classes that are BodyParts
  - Each class will have 3 properties 
  - Each class will have 3 methods
  - At least 15 methods need to be call from another BodyParts
  - At least 10 properties need to be other BodyParts

**Calculator** is a very simple, partially working.. umm, calculator. 

- Single digit functionality for buttons 0 - 9
- Functional operations +,-,*,/,= 
- Label displays value 
- Clear button removes value 

 - Bugs

		- % function partially works, I think it's my math on this one. 
		- Switching sign (+/-) partially working, again likely my math and code. 

  - Todo 

		- Add decimal functionality
